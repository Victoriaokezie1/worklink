# WorkLink

## What WorkLink Does
WorkLink is a platform that connects **Africans with verified remote job opportunities**, making our continent’s talented workforce visible and accessible to employers globally. WorkLink aims to solve the problem of unverified and fake job listings by ensuring adequate screening is done for both the job seekers and job posters using AI technology.

WorkLink goes beyond just matching jobs, it provides a complete ecosystem for remote work:  
- Real-time application tracking  
- Career mentorship and guidance  
- Smart AI-driven matching based off on skills, experience, and interests

## Why WorkLink Matters
There is incredible talent in Africa, but much of it goes **unnoticed globally**. Many Africans struggle to access global and verified remote work opportunities. Meanwhile, global companies are constantly seeking reliable ways to **outsource skilled labor affordably**. Currently, there’s no strong bridge that allows African talent to be **verified and trusted** by employers abroad and vice versa.

WorkLink aims to bridge this gap by:  
- Making African professionals globally visible  
- Providing secure verification of job seekers and employers
